MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn

y = Dependent variable
x1, x2, ..., xn -> independent variable
b0 -> constant

Dummy variables -> to deal with categorical variables
Don't include all dummy variables on the multiple linear regression equation, omit always one.
If we include all variables, we are duplicating (dummy variable trap)

Don't need to apply feature scaling because coefficients will compensate
