Feature scaling after split dataset to prevent data leaking

Normalisation is recommended when we have a normal distribution of data
Standardisation works well all the time

Feature scaling doesn't apply to dummy variables (country matrix variables, e.g.)
MANDATORY: use same scaler in both training set and test set
